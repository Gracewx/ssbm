# Metrics

TODO: The metrics folder is meant to contain specifications and libraries (e.g. in
Python) to compute metrics of spike train outputs. My current suggestion is to
add an efficient implementation of the van Rossum distance with a specified time
grid, filter time constants and normalization.
