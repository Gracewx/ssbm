# SuperSpike benchmark suite

This is v0.1 of the SuperSpike benchmark suite, a collection of benchmarks for 
supervised learning in spiking neural networks. It is meant to make supervised
learning techniques in spiking nets more comparable to each other.

Please see this early version of the suite as an invitation to suggest and add 
your own benchmarks. Please get in touch.
