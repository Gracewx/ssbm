# SLSNB Poisson to Poisson benchmark

The Poisson benchmark is part of the supervised learning in spiking networks
benchmark (SLSNB) suite. The task is to learn a fixed output spike train train
from a number of fixed Poisson input spike trains.  The present directory
contains one input dataset consisting of 200 Poisson spike trains at 5Hz and
duration 200ms a a single target output spiketrain. Spikes are given in the
human readible event based RAS format.  All spikes are aligned to a 0.1ms grid.
